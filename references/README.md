Peak List also maintains a less comprehensive list of peaks here:

Lastly, the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation (MoTCA) periodically releases a list of peaks open to climbing in the annual "Mountaineering Nepal Facts and Figures" publication. Several years of the publication can be downloaded from Nepal in Data via the text search. The most recent publication is 2018:
